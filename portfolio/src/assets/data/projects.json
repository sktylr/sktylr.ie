				"During my second year of college, I took a software engineering module which focused on producing a product for a client. Our client was Xelda, an Irish-based female-led startup attempting to transform how SME's manage their payments stack and working capital. We were tasked with building a RESTful microservice that would integrate with several accountancy service providers and their API's, such as Xero and Sage.",
				"This was my first experience working on a developement team and also the first time I was using Django or Python, so there was a steep learning curve. The project was very hands-on and allowed me to work on the type of project that interested me. We built an API that interacted with the Xero and Sage API's to allow the creation, updating and reading of several accountancy objects, such as invoices, accounts and journals.",
				"I was a junior developer on this project, but also undertook other roles such as scrum master for our scrum meetings. As a junior developer, I was heavily involved in the implementation of the product at a code level. Towards the end of the project, I also worked on the development and upkeep of standards within our microservice to ensure that all of our responses were of the same format and that errors were logged.",
				"This project taught me a huge amount and allowed me to further my skills as a software developer. I was also introduced to many new technologies including Postman, Git and the Django REST Framework."
